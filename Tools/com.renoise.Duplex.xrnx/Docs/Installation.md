# Installation

The easiest way to install Duplex is by downloading the tool (.xrnx) from [tools.renoise.com](http://www.renoise.com/tools/duplex), and then install it by double-clicking or 
dragging the file onto the Renoise application.

Alternatively, you can get the latest version from github (see [Links and Resources](Resources.md))
