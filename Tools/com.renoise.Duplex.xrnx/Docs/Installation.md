# Installation

The easiest way to install Duplex is by downloading the tool (.xrnx) from [tools.renoise.com](http://www.renoise.com/tools/duplex), and then install it by double-clicking or 
dragging the file onto the Renoise application.

Alternatively, you can get the latest version from github (see [Links and Resources](Resources.md)) 

## Post-installation steps

These steps are optional, but might provide a better experience. 

### Review your MIDI device preferences

Duplex is able to complement or replace a MIDI configuration for Renoise. If you are planning to use specific MIDI hardware exclusively with Duplex, you might want to let it be the single source for receiving those messages. This can potentially avoid that "orphaned" MIDI messages (such as control-change message with no mappings) are processed by Renoise as well as Duplex.

### Enable the Renoise OSC Server 

Some features in Duplex is relying on the internal OSC server.
