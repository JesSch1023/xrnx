# Duplex.xrnx

*MIDI/OSC controller framework for Renoise.*

Duplex makes most parts of Renoise controllable via MIDI and OSC-based hardware, thanks to a 
large set of hardware-specific configurations. These bundled configurations come with 
'plug-and-play' support, so you can start using it right away.

What makes Duplex special is the strong focus on bi-directional communication. In practice, this 
will ensure that your controller is always in sync with Renoise, no matter if you change a value 
on screen, or via your controller. 

Duplex can both replace and complement the built-in MIDI mapping in Renoise. The tool will listen 
for messages from your hardware, but can also forward these messages to Renoise, if you so desire.
