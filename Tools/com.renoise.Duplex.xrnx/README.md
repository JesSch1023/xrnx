# Duplex

*MIDI/OSC controller framework for Renoise.*

Duplex is a collection of scripts that control various aspects of Renoise with plug-and-play support for a wide range of hardware. The applications range from controlling basic aspects of the Renoise application (such as the Mixer, DSP chains, Pattern Matrix), to more adventurous applications like sequencers and performance tools. 

Duplex can both replace and complement the built-in MIDI mapping in Renoise. What makes it special is the strong focus on bi-directional communication. In practice, this will ensure that your controller is always in sync with Renoise, no matter if you change a value on screen, or via your controller.
