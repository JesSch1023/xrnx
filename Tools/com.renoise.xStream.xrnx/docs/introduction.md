Welcome to the xStream documentation. 
Written for v1.9. 

## What does it mean to xStream?

xStream is using _live evaluated code_ to "re-program" the pattern editor and automation data. 

It's up to you to decide how to use it: as a composition tool where you "apply" the output to a given range (track or selection), or as a real-time streaming tool, suitable for improvisation and live performances.

The live streaming aspect is the one aspect that makes xStream unique. It's able to record everything, from parameter tweaking to switching between presets. 
This is so, as everything is written into the pattern a moment before it is supposed to play

...illustration...

A kind of brick-road that lays itself out in front of you :D

xStream comes with 'batteries included' - demonstration models that range from basic examples to very advanced ones.
Please take your time to play with some of the provided models before you venture deeper into this tool!

## Further reading

### User interface
An introduction to the various parts that make up the xStream UI. 

### Models
As the previous illustration showed, output is written ahead of the playback. So how does that actually work?
It comes down to a thing called the [model](about_models.md). Essentialy, a small program. 

### File formats
Models can easily be saved and exchanged with with others, as they are entirely text-based.   
Read about the file formats [here](file_formats.md).

### Coding
Once you learn what can be achieved with just a few lines of code, you'll probably want to create new scripts (models) from scratch. This is what the later chapter, [Live Coding with xStream](coding_intro.md), is about.
