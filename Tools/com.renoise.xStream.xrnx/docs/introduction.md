Welcome to the xStream documentation. 
Written for v1.9. 

## What is xStream?

xStream is tool for [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com/tools) that uses _live evaluated code_ to "re-program" the pattern editor and automation data. 

It's up to you to decide how to use it: as a composition tool where you "apply" the output to a given range (track or selection), or as a real-time streaming tool, suitable for improvisation and live performances.

The live streaming makes xStream rather unique. You're able to record every parameter tweak, preset switch with ease. Actually - the hard part is *not* to record these things (hint: you can't). This is so, because everything you hear is the result of notes and pattern commands that got written into the pattern a little bit ahead of time.

Streaming output could be described as a brick-road that is laid out in front of you as you travel forward.
