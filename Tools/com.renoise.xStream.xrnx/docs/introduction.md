Welcome to the xStream documentation. 
Written for v1.9. 

## What is xStream?

xStream is tool for [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com/tools) that uses _live evaluated code_ to "re-program" the pattern editor and automation data. 

The idea is to make the pattern more accessible, by allowing complete control of every aspect. This is done through models, small programs that are constantly evaluated (for each line), can be controlled via [arguments](...) and respond to [events](...). A more thourough introduction to models is located [here](...).

It's up to you to decide how to use it: as a composition tool - where you "apply" the output to a given range (track or selection) - or as a real-time streaming tool, suitable for improvisation and live performances.

However, it's the live streaming aspect that makes xStream unique. When you hit 'play' in xStream, everything you hear is the result of notes and pattern commands that got written into the pattern a little bit ahead of time.

...illustration...

Streaming output could be described as a brick-road that is laid out in front of you as you travel forward. As a result, every parameter tweak, or switched preset is captured in its complete form. Actually - the hard part is *not* to record these things (hint: you can't).
