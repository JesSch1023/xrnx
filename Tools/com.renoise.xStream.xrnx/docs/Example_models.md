# Bundled examples

Here are a few examples to give you a taste of what xStream can be used for:

* **Step Sequencer** - a highly configurable step sequencer with a pattern-FX module for some more unusual effects.  
* **VoiceMgr - Live** - a demonstration of a live MIDI recording workflow, using the voice-manager to control the note duration, polyphony limit and other things.  
* **Exponential Delay** - create 'bouncing ball' simulations, among other things. The controls correspond to physical aspects such as 'gravity', 'energy' and can create a wide variety of rhythms.      
* **Euclidean Rhythms** - ever since it was discovered that Euclidean number ratios can generate useful rhythms, the theory of the famous greek mathematician got applied to music as well.      
* **Granular** - this model generates swervy swarms of chopped-up sounds, using pitch and sample offset commands Ã©n masse. Works best on ambient and atmospheric sounds.
* **Chord Memory** - this model can read chords from the pattern and apply them anywhere. Useful to create shapshots of chord progressions, comes loaded with standard chord presets.
