# Bundled examples

Here are a few examples to give you a taste of what xStream can be used for:

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|**Arpeggiator**|A real-time, MIDI-controllable arpeggiator. There is always room for an arpeggiator.  
|**Step Sequencer**|A step sequencer with a pattern-FX module for some more unusual effects.  
|**VoiceMgr - Live**|A demonstration of a live MIDI recording workflow, using the voice-manager to control the note duration, polyphony limit and other things.  
|**Exponential Delay**|Create 'bouncing ball' simulations, among other things. The controls correspond to physical aspects such as 'gravity', 'energy' and can create a wide variety of rhythms.      
|**Euclidean Rhythms**|Explore Euclidean number ratios to generate rhythms and melodies.      
|**Granular**|Swervy swarms of chopped-up sounds, using pitch and sample offset commands. Works best on ambient and atmospheric sounds.
|**Chord Memory**|This model can read chords from the pattern and apply them anywhere. Useful to create shapshots of chord progressions.
