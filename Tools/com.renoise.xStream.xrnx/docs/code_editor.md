# UI: Code Editor 

< [The user interface](user_interface.md)

The code editor is where it all comes together. By default, the editor will show the _main loop_ of the currently active model.

| Running state | Provides feedback on the state of the code. Errors are displayed with a warning sign, which you can click to read more details. Hopefully, it will read 'Syntax OK' :-)    
| View Select | This popup contains all aspects of the model - the main loop, and (if defined) userdata and event definitions. 
| Add aspect | Add a new aspect to the model (userdata or event handler). Click this to bring up the Callbacks & Userdata dialog
