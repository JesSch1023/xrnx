# About Models

Models are small piece of code that xStream use for transforming and generating pattern data. 

And obviously, the focus in xStream is very much on the 'coding' aspect - creating some logic and getting interesting results from it. But a model can be put together by more than a single lua function. 

To learn how models are structured, read on. Each of these chapters deal with their most important aspects:

## [Live coding](coding_intro.md)

* Getting comfortable with the `main` method
* Sub-methods and data

## [Model arguments](model_arguments.md)

* Control a model using visual components (knob,slider,etc.)
* Organize arguments in tabbed panels
* Can be bound to the Renoise API

## [Model events](model_events.md)

* Track changes in model (arguments)
* Track changes in Renoise API
* Respond to MIDI Input 


## [File formats](...)

* Easily exchangable, plain-text based
* Lua or XML
